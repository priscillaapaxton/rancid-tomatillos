# [Rancid Tomatillos](https://priscillaapaxton.github.io/rancid-tomatillos/)

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Rancid Tomatillos is a movie database where a user can browse through movies and learn details about their budget, reception, and more.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This was our first group project for the third module of Turing's Front-End software development program. This project was completed over a two week duration.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> 
This project served as a valuable learning experience in implementing new technologies including Router, React framework, and Cypress testing. Router played a crucial role in enhancing user experience by enabling seamless transitions between viewing all movies and individual movie details, ensuring speedy responses during navigation. React, on the other hand, provided the organization and reusability of components within our application, leading to easily readable code for developers. The virtual DOM and efficient rendering capabilities of React also significantly improved the performance of our application. Lastly, Cypress end-to-end testing ensured that all DOM elements were accurately rendered across various user scenarios, covering both happy and sad paths.

### Deployment:
To deploy Rancid Tomatillos using GitHub Pages, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have the gh-pages branch available. If it's not already present, use the following command to create and track the branch: git checkout --track origin/gh-pages
2. Make sure that the desired commit is included in the gh-pages branch. If you don't see the commit you want to deploy when running git log, you may need to pull the main branch and merge it into the gh-pages branch.
3. Run the build process in the gh-pages branch by executing the following command: BUILD_PATH=./docs npm run build
4. Add all the changes to the Git staging area by running the command: git add .
5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message indicating that you are deploying to GitHub Pages
6. Finally, push the changes to the gh-pages branch on the remote repository
7. By following these steps, the content inside the /docs directory will be served by GitHub Pages, making your project accessible to others.
